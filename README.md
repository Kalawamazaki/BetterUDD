# BetterUDD
A browser extension that enhances the u.dordt.edu directory with self-reported statuses.

## About
Tired of being the "last one to know" when a relationship starts or ends on campus?  This unofficial extension allows you see other Dordt students' relationshipt statuses and to self-report your own relationship status to make it visible for other students using the u.dordt directory and BetterUDD.

## Installation
When this extension is approved, links to each browser's respective web store will be posted here.

## Credits

- Nathan Yockey
- Luke Esser
